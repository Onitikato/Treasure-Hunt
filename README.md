# Treasure-Hunt
For this project, I was provided with code that established the game environment, represented by a maze, and a basic structure for the TreasureMaze and GameExperience classes. These set up the mazeâ€™s layout, allowed for visualizing the maze, and offered functions to facilitate agent actions and reward system, as well as storing episodes for experience replay. Additionally, I received starter code for building a neural network model and pseudocode for implementing the deep Q-learning algorithm.

My task was to complete the Q-learning algorithm, specifically focusing on creating code for the agent to explore and learn the optimal path to the treasure cell within the maze. This included implementing the main training loop, where the agent selects actions based on exploration vs. exploitation, updates based on environment feedback, and saves these actions in experience replay. I also set up training through a neural network, adjusted exploration settings, and worked toward achieving a high win rate across game episodes.

Connecting Learning to Computer Science
In computer science, professionals design and implement algorithms, like deep Q-learning, to solve complex, real-world problems, often through intelligent agents. This work matters because it forms the basis for many applications in various fields, such as robotics, finance, and healthcare, where automation and adaptive decision-making can provide substantial benefits.

Approaching Problems as a Computer Scientist
When approaching a problem, a computer scientist first defines the goal, breaks it into smaller, manageable steps, and leverages existing knowledge or tools. In this project, I identified key steps from implementing experience replay to tuning hyperparameters, all while iteratively testing and refining the solution.

Ethical Responsibilities
As a computer scientist, I have a responsibility to ensure that algorithms are accurate, fair, and transparent. Solutions must prioritize user safety, privacy, and utility. In this case, ensuring the accuracy of the Q-learning model and providing clear results allows for a transparent and reliable experience for end-users and aligns with ethical standards of developing software that is functional, unbiased, and user-focused.
